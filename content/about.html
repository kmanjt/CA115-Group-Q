    <h4><b>How InspecterCode AI came to be</b></h4>
    <p>InspecterCode AI was made by a passionate group of PhD student programmers with a specialty in AI and machine learning. <br><br>Seeking to incorporate AI into the world of education, we found no machine based tools for aiding programmers in their education.<br><br> At InspecterCode Ltd, we seek to solve that issue and bring a powerful, dynamically learning education tool -- for new and old programmers alike -- to the market.</p>
